# xts objects

An xts object is essentially a time-indexed matrix. We can create xts objects by using the xts() constructor. The inputs are a data matrix and an index. The index must be a time vector with as many values as the number of rows in x and increasing in time. We can use the functions coredata() and index() to extract the data matrix and time index respectively.

```{r cars}
x <- matrix(1:4, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
index <- as.Date(c("2015-01-01", "2015-02-01"))
X <- xts(x, order.by = index)

X
```
